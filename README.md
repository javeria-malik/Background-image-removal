# Background-image-removal
This script processes images from a selected folder by removing backgrounds, resizing them to 256x256 pixels, and saving them as PNG files in a specified output folder. It uses `easygui` for folder selection, `rembg` for background removal, and `PIL` for image manipulation. Ideal for batch processing images with consistent dimensions and format.
Select Input Folder: Run the script and a dialog box will appear prompting you to select the folder containing the images you want to process.
Select Output Folder: Another dialog box will prompt you to select the folder where the processed images will be saved.
Processing: The script will process each image in the input folder by removing the background, resizing it to 256x256 pixels, and saving it as a PNG file in the output folder.
Completion: Once processing is complete, a message will be printed indicating the process is finished and directing you to the output folder to find the processed images.
Important points: make seprate folder name input and place your all input images there. And make seprate folder for output where all images wills save
