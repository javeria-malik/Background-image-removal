# Background-image-removal
This script processes images from a selected folder by removing backgrounds, resizing them to 256x256 pixels, and saving them as PNG files in a specified output folder. It uses `easygui` for folder selection, `rembg` for background removal, and `PIL` for image manipulation. Ideal for batch processing images with consistent dimensions and format.
